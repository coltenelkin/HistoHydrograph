This little function was inspired by a presentation in one of the ESPS talks at AGU's Fall 2023 meeting. It reads in a timeseries of river flow data (doens't have to be a hydrograph; any two arrays of the same length will do) and produces a plot connected to a horizontal histogram of the data. It is capable of handling up to two y-axis arrays (see the examples below).
Hydrograph only:
